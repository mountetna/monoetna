We add a 'query builder' to our manifest editor.

<!--more-->
One of the key ways to grab data via Timur is through *manifests*. A manifest
is a request for data and calculation which sews together a number of different
ways of pulling data from across Mount Etna - for example, raw data from Magma
and calculations from Pythia or Rtemis. Manifests get used all throughout Timur
to make the basic data requests required for making plots and performing other
basic functions, but users can also write their own manifests for pulling down
custom datasets.

The main data source for a manifest is, of course, Magma, which is accessible via
a query API (documented [here](https://github.com/mountetna/magma/wiki/Query)).
The Magma query API is extremely expressive and can download complex subsets of
the entire data graph for a project with a single query.

However, composing such a beast is not always easy. For this reason we've added
a query builder to ease the process. To begin, select the model you wish to
collect:
![Select a model]({{'/assets/images/query1.png'}})

Then select '::all' if you wish to map values from multiple records from this model (the most common type of query):
![Select ::all]({{'/assets/images/query2.png'}})

Last, select a value attribute from the model that you wish to map.
![Select value]({{'/assets/images/query3.png'}})

Your query will now appear and can be copy/pasted into your manifest.

For good measure, you can click "+" on a model to add some filters to it:
![Add filters]({{'/assets/images/query4.png'}})
