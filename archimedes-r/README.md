R interpreter for archimedes.

Some notes touching maintenance / design:
- To reduce build burden within the dev environment and CI testing, all apt-level and R packages are managed within `archimedes-r-base`.  To add R packages, either add them to the DESCRIPTION file `Imports:` section (using the `Remotes:` section as well for packages not in CRAN, per jetpack documentation) or spin up the image with docker to run `jetpack add` / `R -e "jetpack::add(...)"` inside it. Then grab back the updated renv.lock file by running the `extract_package_files.sh` script from within the archimedes-r-base directory.
- `dataflow` for input/output management and any other custom functions that it makes sense to manage within archimedes-r itself can go into `archimedes-r`, but will need to be structured as if they are packages themselves.  Depending on how things go, we could organize as a single package with multiple R scripts to keep distinct types of functions organized, instead of separate folders that each must be staged as their own packages.  Thus meaning only needing one DESCRIPTION file, and one NAMESPACE file, for a single "package" folder inside `archimedes-r/archimedes-r/functions`, with separate scripts in its `R/` folder (dataflow.R, magmaR-setup.R, etc.), and just one `RUN R -e "jetpack::add(...)` call in the DOCKERFILE.  Or they could be broken up into separate folders/packages should our helper functions start to get as diverse as on the python side, but I suspect a single-package structure may work fine here as the pythonian ethos of "write your own function for even minute things" is not the norm in R.
- For drawing the line between `archimedes-r` vs `archimedes-r-base`, consider dependency load as the primary requirement as even just a handful of R package installations takes minutes!  The line should really be ALL pre-compiled packages -> `archimedes-r-base`; simple custom functions that come from repeated script code -> `archimedes-r` though ensuring any dependency libraries are pulled into `archimedes-r-base`.
