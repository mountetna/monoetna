In the realm of the midnight sky,
Where stars whisper and comets fly,
A moonlit dance, a celestial show,
Unfolding secrets we yearn to know.

Galaxies spin in silent grace,
A timeless waltz in the vast embrace.
Planets align in cosmic art,
A symphony of light in the dark.

The night's canvas, an infinite space,
A universe of wonder, a mysterious place.
In the realm of the midnight sky,
Dreams take wing, and spirits fly.
