In the heart of the forest, whispers stir,
A symphony of leaves, the wind's soft purr.
Shadows dance with the light's gentle touch,
In this serene world, time doesn't rush.

A brook babbles secrets to the stones,
Tales of ancient earth, of forgotten bones.
Sunbeams filter through the emerald canopy,
Painting dappled dreams, a verdant tapestry.

Roots entwine in a silent, sacred pact,
A testament to time, an unspoken act.
In the heart of the forest, life's pulse beats,
A world untouched, where the soul retreats.
