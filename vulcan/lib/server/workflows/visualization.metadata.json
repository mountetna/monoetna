Users can fill in these inputs manually, but the recommended method is to build your query in the Timur-Query page ([documentation](https://mountetna.github.io/query.html)), then click the `Plot` button to have the relevant inputs filled in automatically.\n\n## Optional Step 2) Making Data Adjustments\n\n You can preview your data frame and make adjustments to it, using a spreadsheet-like interface. A subset of Excel [functions are supported](https://handsontable.github.io/hyperformula/guide/built-in-functions.html#overview).\n\n## Step 3) Configuring the plot\n\nAfter data is obtained, the Plot Configuration Interface will appear. First choose your plot type from the similarly named dropdown, then additional inputs will show up which allow you to set what data to use for axes, colors, etc. and as other advanced options.\n\nFor additional details regarding individual inputs of the Plot Configuration Interface, see https://mountetna.github.io/vulcan.html#the-plot-configuration-interface.\n\n## Recent Updates:\n\n- UI upgade: If you notice the sleek new look of most of our input components, it's because were converted them to make use of the robust and beautiful MaterialUI library.\n- Plot Config Organization: plot options are now grouped into categories.\n- Plot Config data restriction: When required for the desired plot type, dropdowns for certain inputs will be restricted to show only continuous or discrete data options.\n\n## We are currently working on:\n\n- Additional Visualization Features",
