After selecting a set of samples, data is retrieved, cells are filtered based on QC inputs, and the data is normalized and scaled (with regression of parameters based on user-input) prior to PCA calculation. Next, the neightborhood graph is calculated and used to power UMAP & clustering (again with tunable user inputs). Finally, users can download teir processed data, and visualize their UMAP colored by clustering, gene expression, or other features.",
