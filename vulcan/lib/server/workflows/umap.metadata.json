After clicking the run button again, records matching those criteria are then retrieved and presented to the user for approval. Once sample selections are confirmed, but clicking the run button another time, the associated raw counts data is retrieved and merged, then processed.\n\nData processing begins with filtering cells based on QC inputs, and counts data normalization. For dimensionality reduction and clustering purposes, optional regression of normalized data based on certain parameters comes next, followed by scaling and PCA calculation. Next, the neightborhood graph is calculated and used to power both UMAP & clustering (again with tunable user inputs).\n\nFinally, after all these processing steps are complete, users are presented with an option to download their processed data, and also to visualize their UMAP colored by clustering, gene expression, or other features (which will vary from project to project).\n\n#### Note: Refer to in-line (?) icons for additional information about specific inputs.",
