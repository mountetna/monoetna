Next, the neightborhood graph is calculated and used to power UMAP & clustering (again with tunable user inputs). Finally, users can download their processed data, and visualize their UMAP colored by clustering, gene expression, or other features.\n\n#### Note: Refer to in-line (?) icons for additional information about specific inputs.",
