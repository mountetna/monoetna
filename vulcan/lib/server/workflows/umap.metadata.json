After sample selections are confirmed, data is retrieved, cells are filtered based on QC inputs, and the data is normalized and scaled (with regression of parameters based on user-input) prior to PCA calculation. Next, the neightborhood graph is calculated and used to power UMAP & clustering (again with tunable user inputs). Finally, users can download their processed data, and visualize their UMAP colored by clustering, gene expression, or other features.\n\n#### Note: Refer to in-line (?) icons for additional information about specific inputs.\n\n## Selection Features of each project\n\nEach project allows selection of records based on a combination of three data features. These are shown in the main user interface only in reference to the numbers below (for now):\n\n#### HuMu:\n\n1. 'Experiment': data target = 'experiment#alias'\n2. 'Tissue': data target = 'biospecimen_group#biospecimen_type'\n3. 'Fraction': data target = 'sc_seq#cell_fraction'",
