  "vignette": "# Workflow for: Single-cell Visualization\n\nThis workflow allows exploration of pre-processed single-cell datasets.\n\n## The Vulcan Interface:\n\nThe interface is set up in 3 sections:\n\n- The left side is for user inputs.\n- The center section is where the UMAP will appear as well as any other outputs, which will include the processed scanpy object and tables of differential expression results.\n- The right section is where the user can track underlying steps of the pipeline which have been run or are currently running.\n\nTo move forwards through the workflow, use the `Commit`-button after making selections to record your inputs, then use the `Run`-button at the top of the screen to request new work be run.\n\n## Usage Notes:\n\n- Under Construction\n- For convenience, after reaching the 'Set plot options' step for the first time, you can set it to 'Auto-Commit in future'. Doing so will set the step to be committed and run with its default settings whenever the step is freshly reached again (e.g.: you selected a different parameter in the Color Options step), essentially skipping the breakpoint that the step otherwise causes. \n\n## Overview of Workflow Steps:\n\n### Future Feature Addition Plans:\n\n- Additional visualization methods.\n\n#### Additional Notes:\n\n- Remember that you can check in-line (?) icons for further information about specific steps/inputs!",
