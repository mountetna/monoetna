At present, that data must come from a 'query' of magma data, but we hope to provide other options in the future.\n\n## Selecting Data via Timur-Query:\n\nThis Data Loading method uses the 'Data Source magma query' Primary Inputs group. The easiest way to establish the proper inputs for querying from magma is to utilize the Timur-Query page. You can use Timur-Query's own documentation to learn how to set up that page to query the data you want. After setting up your query targets there: \n\n- 'query input': Copy here the 'query:' portion of the Query page's green box.\n- 'user_columns input': Copy here the 'user_columns:' portion of Query page's green box.\n- 'expand_matrices input': [Recommendation = leave as is.] This input defaults to True both here and in the Query page (where it exists as a slider button below the green box). Normally, you will want to leave it True as the non-expanded format is less accessible to the visualization machinery here.\n\n## Generating the plot\n\nAfter data is obtained, a new user input widget will show up in which you can select which columns to use for the x axis groupings, the y axis values, and which data representations (violin plots, box plots, or both), as well as other advanced options. NOTE: The data selected for the x axis must be discrete (not continuous) to establish groupings while the data selected for the y axis must be numeric.\n\nFor additional details regarding all inputs for at this stage, see https://mountetna.github.io/vulcan.html#the-setup-gui.\n\n#### We plan to make the Timur-Query -> Vulcan workflow transfer process simpler in the future!",
